## Logic Description
The application follows a clear logic flow for user authentication and news browsing without delving into code specifics:

1. **App Initialization**:
   - The app initializes Firebase for authentication and starts on the sign-in screen to ensure secure access.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - **Sign-In**:
     - Users enter their email and password.
     - The system validates credentials and checks if the user exists.
     - If valid, the user is directed to the home screen with news articles.
     - Invalid credentials trigger error messages (e.g., "No user found" or "Incorrect password").
   - **Sign-Up**:
     - Users provide an email and password.
     - The system creates a new user account if the email is valid and not already in use.
     - After sign-up, the user is redirected to the sign-in screen to log in.
     - Errors (e.g., invalid email, weak password) display user-friendly messages.
   - **Sign-Out**:
     - Users can log out from the home screen, clearing cached data and returning to the sign-in screen.
     - The system ensures no news data is accessible until the user logs in again.

3. **News Browsing**:
   - **Category Selection**:
     - The home screen displays a horizontal list of categories (e.g., general, business, sports).
     - Users tap a category to load articles specific to that category.
   - **Article Loading**:
     - The system checks for cached articles for the selected category.
     - If cached data is recent (within a set time, e.g., one hour), it displays those articles.
     - Otherwise, it fetches new articles from the News API for the selected category and country (default: US).
     - Fetched articles are cached locally for future use.
   - **Article Display**:
     - Articles are shown as cards with a title, image (if available), brief description, and publication date.
     - Tapping an article navigates to a details screen.
   - **Article Details**:
     - The details screen shows the articleâ€™s title, image, content, and publication date.
     - A button allows users to view the full article in a web view.
   - **Web View**:
     - The full article is loaded in a browser view within the app, using the articleâ€™s URL.
   - **Refresh**:
     - Users can pull down to refresh the article list, fetching the latest news from the API.

4. **Data Caching**:
   - Articles are cached locally with a timestamp to track freshness.
   - Cache is cleared on logout or can be cleared for a specific category.
   - Cached data reduces API calls and improves performance when network connectivity is poor.

5. **User Interface**:
   - The sign-in and sign-up screens feature email and password fields, a submit button, and a toggle link to switch between modes.
   - The home screen includes a category selector, article list, and logout button.
   - Article cards are visually appealing with images and truncated text for readability.
   - The details screen highlights article content with a dark theme and a button to access the full article.
   - A loading indicator appears during data fetching or authentication.
   - The app uses a dark theme with custom fonts for a modern look.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Invalid inputs (e.g., empty fields, invalid email) display clear error messages.
   - API errors (e.g., rate limit exceeded, network issues) show user-friendly messages with a retry option.
   - Authentication errors (e.g., wrong password, user not found) are communicated clearly.
   - A loading indicator prevents multiple submissions during authentication or data fetching.

## Usage
1. **Accessing the App**:
   - Open the app and land on the sign-in screen.
   - Sign up with a valid email and password, then log in with those credentials.
   - Alternatively, log in with an existing account.

2. **Browsing News**:
   - On the home screen, select a category from the horizontal list.
   - View the list of articles, each showing a title, image, and brief description.
   - Tap an article to see its details, including full content and publication date.
   - Click the"*Read Full Article"* to open the article in a web view.
   - Pull down to refresh the article list for the latest news.
   - Log out using the home screenâ€™s logout button, which clears cached data.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Articles are cached locally for one hour, ensuring offline access to recent news.
   - Cache is user-specific and cleared on logout.
